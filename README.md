## Question
How is the Pixar Cinematic Universe Connected? 

## Introduction
We all know about the Pixar Easter eggs. It’s impossible to watch a Pixar movie without catching a glimpse of Pizza Planet. But how connected are the 27 Pixar movies, really? Our project sought to find out how many connections exist between each movie and which movies were most important in facilitating the network structure of Pixar movies. 

## Research Method
In order to create our initial dataset, we researched easter eggs from each Disney Pixar movie, looking at Toy Story (1995) up until the upcoming unreleased Elemental (2023). Using information from blog posts and videos from Disney blogs and fan websites ([see full list of sites here](https://github.com/indigoparlin/sna-pixar-easter-eggs/blob/main/sources.txt)), we created a matrix in Google sheets that connected emblems of Pixar in the film they appeared in to the film they were originally from. We also documented the appearances of the Luxo (Pixar) Ball and the Pizza Planet Truck which are two symbols that supposedly appear in every Disney Pixar movie, starting with Toy Story. 
We utilized Python Package Networkx to compute our results in a Google Colab Notebook. You can view our [eastereggs.csv](https://github.com/indigoparlin/sna-pixar-easter-eggs/blob/main/eastereggs.csv) and [pixareastereggs.ipynb](https://github.com/indigoparlin/sna-pixar-easter-eggs/blob/main/pixareastereggs.ipynb) in this repository. 

## Results
![Graph produced by Networkx](https://github.com/indigoparlin/sna-pixar-easter-eggs/blob/main/graph.png)

**Movie most referenced by others:** Toy Story (1995)

**Least referenced movie:** Elemental (2023)

**Highest degree centrality:** Toy Story (1995)

**Lowest degree centrality:** Elemental (2023)

**Closeness centrality:** Toy Story (1995), followed by Monsters, Inc. (2001)

**Highest eigenvector centrality:** Toy Story (1995), followed by Monsters, Inc. (2001) and Finding Nemo (2003)

**Highest betweenness centrality:** Finding Nemo (2003), followed by Toy Story (1995)


**PageRank Results:**
The top three movies with the highest PageRank score are: Toy Story (1995), A Bug’s Life (1998), and Toy Story 2 (1999). 
The bottom three movies with the lowest PageRank score are: Turning Red (2022), Lightyear (2022), and Elemental (2023). 

The **histogram chart** represents the degree distribution of all the Pixar films by counting the occurrence of each degree. For example, the graph shows how 4 films have a degree of 18 (Finding Nemo, Toy Story 3, Inside Out, and Soul). The highest degree is 28, corresponding to Toy Story. This aligns with our earlier data in which Toy Story has repetitively had the most references to it from other films. In contrast, Elemental, which has not been released yet, has just one reference to it from another film. Nodes of degree 2, 3, 4, 14, and 21-26 are non-existent.

## Impact & Future Research
Many people know about the Pixar hidden easter eggs but don’t know the depth that the animators go to include them nor the way that they connect Pixar as a Cinematic Universe. This project, for all movies up until Elemental (2023), provides a comprehensive network for film fanatics interested in seeing how their favorite films connect without having to track down the information in random Buzzfeed articles or re-watching all of the films themselves. As Pixar continues to create and produce more movies, the network we have created today will continue to expand. It will be interesting to continue this network analysis as new movies are produced, animators and production teams change, and as new iconic easter eggs and inside jokes, like A113, are created.
