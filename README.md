## Question
We all know about the Pixar Easter eggs. Itâ€™s impossible to watch a Pixar movie without catching a glimpse of Pizza Planet. But how connected are the 27 Pixar movies, really? Our project sought to find out how many connections exist between each movie and which movies were most important in facilitating the network structure of Pixar movies.
